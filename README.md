Having a large record collection I ran into a problem... <br/>
<br/>
When guests come over they get excited about the idea of picking a record. But actually flipping through a large and unknown collection can be a daunting task. <br/>
<br/>
That's why I created this html. Now I can set up a QR code, let guests pull up my collection on their phones, and they can sort, search and preview to their hearts content. <br/>
<br>
This was developed and formatted specifically for mobile. It won't work on desktop, but feel free to recycle the code for your own needs. I tested all of this on a Galaxy S21 Ultra. <br/>

** *ONE IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT SECURITY: This HTML WILL reveal your Spotify and Discogs API's so either use locally or improve the security to your needs.* **

### To use the file, simply insert your Spotify (lines 507 & 508) and Discogs (lines 566 & 567) API information and share and display as you see fit.
